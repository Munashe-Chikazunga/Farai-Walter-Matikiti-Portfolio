## Getting Started

### Viewing the Website

1. **Visit the Website URL**: You can view the live version of the website by visiting [YourWebsiteURL](https://example.com).
2. **Clone the Repository** (for local development): If you want to view or make changes to the site locally on your computer, you can clone the repository.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
    ```
3. **Open in Browser**: Once cloned, navigate to the project directory and open any `.html` file in your preferred browser.

### Making Edits

If you wish to make changes to the website, you can follow these steps:

1. **Open the Repository**: Navigate to the GitHub repository or use a local code editor such as **VS Code**.
2. **Edit the HTML Pages**:
    - To update **content**, simply modify the text inside the relevant `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, or `<div>` tags in the `index.html`, `about.html`, or `portfolio.html` files.
3. **Image Changes**:
    - **Hero Section Images**: Update the image paths (`images/farai-picture2.jpg`, etc.) to replace or change the hero section images.
4. **CSS Adjustments**:
    - The styling for the website is done inline within the `<style>` tags of each HTML page.
    - You can modify colors, sizes, and effects by editing the CSS code.

### Publishing Changes

1. **Commit Changes**:
    - After making your changes, make sure you commit them.
    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Updated content or styling"
    ```
2. **Push to GitHub**:
    - Push the committed changes to GitHub.
    ```sh
    git push origin main
    ```

3. **Deploying**: 
    - If hosted on **GitHub Pages**, your changes should automatically be reflected once pushed. 
    - If using **another hosting platform** like Netlify, ensure you trigger a build or redeploy after pushing.

## Editing Tips

- **Navigation Bar**: To add or remove links from the navigation, edit the `<nav>` tag in each HTML file.
- **Content Updates**: For regular updates like adding new projects or modifying skills, locate the corresponding section in the appropriate HTML file and simply add/edit the list items.
- **Hero Section Changes**:
  - If you'd like to change the hero section images, replace the file in the `images/` folder and update the `background-image` URL in the `<style>` tag of each page.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Image Not Loading**:
   - Ensure the image file is correctly placed in the `/images` directory.
   - Verify that the image path in the HTML matches the file name and location (paths are case-sensitive).

2. **Changes Not Reflecting**:
   - **Clear Browser Cache**: Sometimes changes may not immediately reflect due to caching. Try doing a **hard refresh** (usually `Ctrl + F5`).
   - **Check Console for Errors**: If elements are not displaying properly, open the browser console (`F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`) and check for any error messages.

## Website Maintenance

- **Regular Updates**: Regularly update the **portfolio section** to keep it current with your latest projects.
- **Content Management**: Use an HTML editor to make content changes, or consult your web developer if the changes are more complex.
- **SEO Optimization**: Update titles and meta tags as needed to optimize the site for search engines.
